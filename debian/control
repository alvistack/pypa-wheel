Architecture: all
Description: Built-package format for Python
 A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename and
 the .whl extension. It is designed to contain all the files for a PEP
 376 compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk
 format. Many packages will be properly installed with only the "Unpack"
 step (simply extracting the file onto sys.path), and the unpacked
 archive preserves enough information to "Spread" (copy data and scripts
 to their final locations) at any later time.
